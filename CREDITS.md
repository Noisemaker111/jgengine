# Credits

JGengine's outdoor-world layer stands on the shoulders of open work by others.
This file records that debt and thanks the people whose projects shaped ours.

Huge thanks to **[achrefelouafi](https://github.com/achrefelouafi)** (chiro
achrefelouafi). Four of JGengine's environment renderers — **procedural
buildings, water, rain, and snow** — were shaped from ideas, math, and shader
techniques in his MIT-licensed Three.js reference projects. Every one of them is
worth reading in full; they are clear, self-contained, and beautifully done.

| JGengine feature | Where it lives | Derived from (MIT) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Procedural buildings** | [`core/world/buildings.ts`](packages/core/src/world/buildings.ts), [`shell/structures/GeneratedBuilding.tsx`](packages/shell/src/structures/GeneratedBuilding.tsx) | [BuildingGeneratorThreeJS](https://github.com/achrefelouafi/BuildingGeneratorThreeJS) — a procedural Hong Kong building generator ported from a Blender geometry-nodes setup. Our seeded facade/roof kit (windows, awnings, AC units, clotheslines, storefronts, shutters, store signs, roof props, guardrails, corners) follows the component vocabulary and placement logic of his generator. |
| **Water** | [`core/world/water.ts`](packages/core/src/world/water.ts), [`shell/water/`](packages/shell/src/water) | [OceanThreejs](https://github.com/achrefelouafi/OceanThreejs) — a cinematic, physically based ocean renderer. Our Gerstner wave surface, crest/foam shading, and Fresnel water color draw directly on his ocean techniques. |
| **Rain** | [`shell/weather/RainField.tsx`](packages/shell/src/weather/RainField.tsx) | [RainSystemThreeJS](https://github.com/achrefelouafi/RainSystemThreeJS) — GPU-instanced rain. Our camera-following instanced rain volume is shaped from his system. |
| **Snow** | [`shell/weather/SnowField.tsx`](packages/shell/src/weather/SnowField.tsx) | [SnowSystemThreeJS](https://github.com/achrefelouafi/SnowSystemThreeJS) — a fully procedural snow studio with GPU-instanced snowfall. Our drifting, swaying snow volume is shaped from his system. |

A related nod: JGengine's grass field
([`shell/terrain/GrassField.tsx`](packages/shell/src/terrain/GrassField.tsx))
took cues from his [GrassSystemThreeJS](https://github.com/achrefelouafi/GrassSystemThreeJS).

These are ports and re-implementations, not copies: JGengine's versions are
renderer-agnostic (the wave math and building generator live in dependency-free
`@jgengine/core`), prop-driven, and stripped of the reference projects' GUI,
audio, post-processing, and app-specific scene setup. But the good ideas are
his. Each source project is MIT-licensed; go star them.
