## Movement, pose, input

```ts
ctx.player.movement.getPose(id) / setPose(id, "crouch")   // validates catalog movement.poses
ctx.player.movement.getAim(id) / setAim(id, "ads")        // ADS = aim state + zoom modifier, not a pose
```

Poses (`standing/crouch/prone/running`) change the collision capsule (`POSE_HITBOX`); aim pairs with a `player.stats` zoom modifier on `"reticle"`. Game code reads action names only (`isDown("aim")`, `wasPressed("interact")`) — hold vs toggle is resolved by the binding config, never by raw key branches.

### `ctx.input` — polling the raw controls

`ctx.input` (`@jgengine/core/runtime/inputSnapshot`) is a per-frame held-action snapshot for `onTick` to poll, distinct from the command-dispatch path (bound actions still run commands the normal way): `publish(held: readonly string[])` (the shell calls this once per frame before `onTick`), `isDown(action)`, `held()` for the full list. Publishing never bumps `ctx.version()` — it's a poll surface, not reactive state.

**`repeatMs`** — bind an action as `{ hold: [...], repeatMs: 150 }` (`input/actionBindings`) and the shell fires its command on the down edge, then again every `repeatMs` while held, resetting on release (hotbar-style repeat-fire without a per-game timer).

**Aim on generic commands** — every command resolved from a bound action now runs with `{ yaw, pitch, aim: { yaw, pitch } }` in its payload, so a handler can read the camera-relative aim without going through `pointer.worldHit()`.

### Controller kinematics — movement config, physics tuning, respawn

`PlayableGame.movement` (`PlayerMovementConfig`) tunes the shell's built-in walk controller (never touch `PhysicsWorld` for ordinary player movement):

```ts
movement: {
  mode?: "free" | "axis" | "grid";           // "free" (default) camera-relative; "axis" locks travel to one world axis; "grid" snaps each committed position to cell centers
  axis?: "x" | "z";                          // world axis for mode "axis". Default "x"
  cellSize?: number;                         // cell size for mode "grid". Default 1
  collideObjects?: boolean;                  // collide the walking player against placed scene objects (unit-box AABBs) even without collision.voxel
  beforeCommit?: (frame: MovementCommitFrame) => readonly [number, number, number] | undefined | void;   // intercepts each frame's resolved position before the pose commits; return a replacement to constrain/redirect the step
}
```

`nav/navConstrain`'s `constrainToNavGrid(grid, { y? })` is a standalone walkable-pass-through + wall-sliding helper over a `nav/navGrid`; its `(proposed, entity)` shape doesn't match `beforeCommit`'s `(frame) => [x,y,z]` signature directly, so wire it in with a small adapter closure rather than passing it straight through.

`defineGame({ physics: { gravity, jumpVelocity } })` drives the kinematics controller directly: `gravity` (signed, e.g. `-24`) and `jumpVelocity` override the built-in tuning; omit either to keep the defaults. This is the one global exception to "never player tuning in `defineGame`" — it configures the shared controller, not a catalog entry. It is still **distinct** from `physics/physicsWorld`'s standalone rigid-body sim (see below) — `defineGame.physics` never touches that sim.

**Vertical motion intents** — `ctx.player.motion` (`@jgengine/core/runtime/motionIntents`): `impulse(vy)` adds to the vertical velocity the shell's controller is about to integrate, `setVerticalVelocity(vy)` replaces it outright, `setY(y)` wins over physics for that frame. The shell calls `takePending()` once per frame, before integrating gravity, to drain what accumulated; this is not reactive state (jump pads, launch abilities, bounce pads).

**`collision: { voxel: true }` — object lattice as solids.** When set, the shell's local player uses a voxel body whose `isSolid(x,y,z)` is rebuilt from `ctx.scene.object.list()` as exact `` `${x},${y},${z}` `` keys (integer cell queries). Integer-placed objects are walkable/blocking; fractional-coord objects decorate without colliding. Removing an object opens a real trapdoor under gravity — do not fake the fall with `setPose`. `visual.scale` does not shrink the collider (always a unit cell). The voxel body is created once; prefer `motion.setY` / `impulse` for vertical relocation — full XY teleport of the local voxel body is not supported. Solid cache rebuilds when object **count** changes. Recipe: `jgengine` → voxel trapdoor board.

**Respawn** — `ctx.scene.entity.spawnPoseOf(id)` reads the spawn pose, `resetToSpawn(id)` teleports back to it with zero velocity, `resetAllToSpawn(filter?)` does it for every entity matching an optional filter and returns the count (round resets, out-of-bounds recovery).

## Touch & mobile

Every game is touch-playable with zero per-game input code. On a coarse-pointer device the shell derives a `TouchScheme` from the game's `input` bindings (`deriveTouchScheme`, `@jgengine/core/input/touchScheme`): a virtual joystick binds whichever of `moveForward`/`moveBack`/`moveLeft`/`moveRight` (or `turnLeft`/`turnRight`) are bound, on-screen buttons cover the remaining actions, and drag-to-look mounts automatically for `first`-person camera rigs. Touch controls feed synthetic `touch:<action>` codes into the same `ActionStateTracker` the keyboard uses — game code reads `isDown`/`wasPressed` and never branches on input source.

Refine the derived scheme with the `touch` field of `defineGame({...})` (`TouchControlsConfig`, all optional):

```ts
touch: {
  gestures: {
    tap: "rotateCw",
    swipeUp: "hold",
    swipeDown: "hardDrop",
    drag: { left: "shiftLeft", right: "shiftRight" },
  },
  buttons: [
    { action: "rotateCcw", label: "CCW" },
    { action: "softDrop", label: "Soft" },
  ],
},
```

- **`gestures`** — bind `tap` / `swipeUp` / `swipeDown` / `swipeLeft` / `swipeRight` / `drag` (`{ left?, right?, up?, down?, stepPx? }`, repeats its action every `stepPx` of travel) on the play surface. An action consumed by a gesture is removed from the derived button set.
- **`buttons`** — curate the on-screen cluster (order preserved; bare string or `{ action, label?, icon? }`); omit to auto-derive one button per remaining bound action. Buttons render a glyph, not text: `iconForAction` (`@jgengine/react/gameIcons`) resolves the action name to a `GameIconName` (`jump`, `sprint`, `rotateCw`, `hardDrop`, `swap`, `hand`, `restart`, arrows, …), the `label` becomes the `aria-label`; set `icon: "<GameIconName>"` to pick one explicitly or `icon: false` to force the text label.
- **`hidden`** — actions to drop from the derived buttons without gesture-binding them.
- **`movement: false`** — suppress the virtual joystick even when movement actions are bound.
- **`look` / `lookSensitivity`** — drag-to-look on the play surface; defaults to `true` for `first`-person camera rigs, `0.005` radians/px.
- **`touch: false`** — opt out entirely when the game's own DOM UI is already touch-native.

`useDisplayProfile()` (`@jgengine/react/display`) reports `{ coarsePointer, compact, portrait }` — live media-query state, SSR-safe — for adaptive HUD layout; see the mobile/touch rules in [`../jgengine-ui/reference.md`](https://github.com/Noisemaker111/jgengine/blob/main/.claude/skills/jgengine-ui/reference.md).

## Interaction — `proximityPrompt`

One primitive for all float UI: `{ radius, display, invoke }` where `display` is `{ kind: "keybind", actionId }` | `{ kind: "gauge", gaugeId }` | `{ kind: "label", text }` and `invoke` is `{ command, args? }` or null (display-only). `talkable: "dialogue_id"` on an entity expands to a talk prompt. Engine picks the nearest prompt in radius (priority tie-break). Never build per-game hint resolver chains.

## Pointer-driven input and navigation
The **pointer is a service, not per-game glue**. Opt in with `camera` plus a `pointer` config in `defineGame({...})`; the shell casts the cursor into the world and dispatches commands you define — verbs stay commands, catalogs stay data.
- **`pointer.worldHit()` (shell service).** The shell raycasts the cursor to `{ point, normal, entity, object }` (a renderer-free `PointerHit` from `@jgengine/core/input/pointer`) — entity/object are the topmost instance ids under the cursor, else `null`, with a ground-plane fallback for open terrain. Consume it renderer-free: `aimToPoint(origin, point)` builds an `Aim` for `item.use`/projectiles (ground-target skillshots, twin-stick), `groundOf(hit)` drops to `[x, z]` for routing. `pointer.worldHitCenter()` is the same raycast pinned to the viewport center instead of the live cursor — the reticle-aim query a locked/hidden-cursor rig (first-person, gamepad) needs when there is no cursor position to read.
- **The `pointer` field of `defineGame({...})`** (all optional): `moveCommand` (left-click ground → `run(cmd, { point, entity, object })`, click-to-move), `select` (left-drag marquee + single-click box-select of entities), `orderCommand` (right-click ground → `run(cmd, { selection, point })`, issue a command to the selection), `contextMenu` (right-click an entity/object → its catalog `verbs` menu), `secondaryCommand` (right-click ground/entity/object → `run(cmd, { point, entity, object, aim })` when neither `orderCommand` nor `contextMenu` claims the click — a generic right-click verb for games with no selection/RTS model), `aim` (route the primary ability's aim to the cursor), `grabWorldItems` (left-click a `worldItem` within pickup radius → engine-owned `ctx.scene.worldItem.pickup`, no game command). Enabling `select`/`moveCommand` frees the left button for verbs; orbit moves to middle-drag.
- **`createDragCapture({ maxPull?, grabRadius? })`** (`@jgengine/core/input/pointer`) — a renderer-agnostic slingshot/drawback state machine: `begin(origin, at)` starts a pull (rejected outside `grabRadius`), `update(at)` tracks the cursor, `release()` returns the final `DragState { origin, current, pull, magnitude, fraction }` (pull clamped to `maxPull`), `cancel()` aborts. Angry Birds-style slingshots, bow drawback, throwable wind-up — pair with `aimToPoint` to fire.
- **Selection math** (`scene/selection`) is pure and testable: `createSelectionSet()`, `screenRect`/`selectWithinRect`/`isMarquee` over projected screen points.
- **Context menu** (`interaction/contextMenu`): a catalog entity/object carries `verbs: contextVerb(label, command, args?)[]`; the shell builds the menu with `buildContextMenu` and dispatches the chosen command via `contextVerbInput` (verb args + `target`/`point`, so one handler can walk-then-act).
- **Navmesh + A\*** (`nav/navGrid`): `createNavGrid({ bounds, cellSize, diagonal? })` → mark obstacles with `blockAabb`/`setWalkable`, or `populateNavGridFromEnvironment(grid, world)` to block every generated building's footprint on an `environment()` world's `structures` in one call (returns the count blocked) instead of hand-walking the district. `findPath(grid, from, to, { clearance?, smooth?, stepCost? })` returns a string-pulled `[x, z]` polyline (blocked start/goal snap to the nearest walkable cell) feeding **both click-to-move and AI routing**; `stepCost?(from, to)` multiplies the base cost of a grid step — `slopeStepCost(terrainField, weight?)` is the ready-made factory that penalizes steep terrain (routes around cliffs instead of over them). Renderer-free — AI and gameplay consume it without the shell.
- **`pathFollow`** (`nav/pathFollow`): the lighter authored-polyline mover for tower-defense creeps that needs no navmesh — `createPathFollow({ waypoints, speed, loop? })` + pure `advancePathFollow(config, state, dt)` (crosses multiple waypoints per tick, reports `done`/`heading`/`distanceTravelled`). Feed it a navmesh route with `pathFromNav(route, elevation, offset?)` and the same follower drives click-to-move — `elevation` is either a fixed `y` or a `{ sampleHeight(x, z) }` field (any `TerrainField` qualifies), so a route across relief rides the ground instead of a flat plane.
- **`constrainToNavGrid(grid, { y? })`** (`nav/navConstrain`) is a standalone walkable-pass-through + wall-slide helper: it passes through walkable moves, slides along walls at the navmesh boundary instead of stopping dead, and optionally remaps `y` to the grid. Its `(proposed, entity)` shape doesn't match `PlayerMovementConfig.beforeCommit`'s `(frame) => [x,y,z]` signature, so wire it in with a small adapter closure (see "Controller kinematics" above) to wall a player/AI to the same navmesh `findPath` already routes against.
## AI — director, threat, jobs, crowds (`ai/*`)
Renderer-free AI over the same navmesh (`findPath`/`pathFollow`) gameplay already uses. Everything ticks on **game-time `dt`** (the `ctx.time` simClock delta), so it obeys pause and fast-forward for free. Manifests, patrol routes, job definitions, threat weights, and POIs are **game data** — the primitives own the loop, the catalog owns the content.
- **Spawn director** (`ai/spawnDirector`) — budgets and escalates spawns for wave shooters and difficulty directors (Brotato, Bloons TD 6, Risk of Rain 2, Helldivers 2, Deep Rock Galactic). `createSpawnDirectorState(config)` then pure `advanceSpawnDirector(config, state, dt, { alive, players? })` → `{ state, spawns: SpawnRequest[] }`. Each `WaveManifest` grants a `budget` spent on affordable weighted `SpawnEntry`s (`cost`/`weight`/`minWave`), capped by `maxAlive`; `duration` auto-advances waves (or call `advanceWave` on "wave cleared"). Budget also trickles via `budgetPerSecond`, ramps a difficulty curve with `escalationPerSecond` (grows with sim-time), scales with `playerBudgetPerSecond`, and surges on `raiseAlert(state, amount)` decaying over time (bug-breach/dropship escalation). Seeded (`seed`) so ticks are deterministic. `pickSpawnPoint(points, players, { roll, bias })` biases placement toward (or away from) players. `config.spawnPoints?: NavPoint[]` lets the director pick a point itself: each `SpawnRequest` then also carries `point` (the chosen `[x, z]`, biased by `config.spawnPointBias`) and `laneId` (the point's index into `spawnPoints`) — feed multiple named lanes/portals and read `laneId` back to route the spawned entity down its lane instead of correlating positions by hand.
- **Threat table** (`ai/threat`) — MMO/extraction aggro (Escape from Tarkov, WoW-style tanking). `createThreatTable({ decayPerSecond?, max?, forgetBelow? })`: `add(source, amount)` accumulates, `decay(dt)` bleeds off per game-second and forgets emptied sources, `highest({ current?, stickiness? })` returns the top-threat source to feed `scene/targeting` — `stickiness` (e.g. 1.1) keeps the current target until another exceeds it by that factor, so aggro doesn't jitter. `taunt(source, durationSeconds)` forces the mob onto a tank for that window (overriding `highest`) and lifts the taunter's threat to the current top so aggro stays after the window; `forcedTarget()` reports the active taunt, `decay(dt)` counts it down. `ranked()` for a threat meter.
- **Patrol** (`scene/behaviors`) — `patrol({ waypoints, speed, loop? })` is a `BehaviorDescriptor` (a route is data) that layers a fixed beat on top of `wander`; drive it with `createPathFollow`/`advancePathFollow` (lane creeps, scav patrols in Deadlock/Tarkov). Route waypoints between guard posts with `findPath`.
- **Job board** (`ai/jobBoard`) — colony/companion task assignment (Palworld stations, Schedule I employees, Sons of the Forest directives). `createJobBoard()`: `post(job)` a `JobDef` (`station`, `work` seconds, `priority`, `arriveRadius`, `repeat`), `claim(worker)` auto-pulls the highest-priority queued job or `assign(worker, jobId)` for a player order (steals it from its holder), `release` requeues. Per tick `advance(worker, dt, { distanceToStation })` runs the state machine `travelling → working → done` (path to `station(worker)` via `findPath`, occupy, run the loop), returning a `JobReport` on completion; `repeat` jobs re-run as a production loop and report each cycle.
- **Crowd flow** (`ai/crowd`) — many agents routing to their own points of interest with congestion (Two Point Museum corridors, Dave the Diver seating). `computeFlowField(grid, goals, { clearance?, congestion? })` runs Dijkstra from the goals over the walkable grid → `direction(point)`/`next(point)` steer any agent toward the nearest goal (no per-agent A*). `createCrowdField(grid)` tracks per-cell occupancy (`enter`/`leave`/`count`); pass `crowd.penalty(weight)` as the field's `congestion` to reroute flow around crowded cells each tick. `selectPoi(pois, from, { roll, occupancy?, distanceBias?, distance? })` weights a POI by appeal and proximity, skips ones at `capacity`, and accepts a `distance` override (e.g. `findPath` length) to choose over the navmesh, not line-of-sight.
- **Factions & reputation** (`faction/factions`, `faction/reputation`) — allegiance-based hostility for RPGs/MMOs/strategy (WoW-style Horde-vs-Alliance, at-war reputation grinds, guards-vs-thieves). `createFactionGraph({ factions, symmetric?, unaligned? })` models a faction-vs-faction relation matrix — each `FactionDef` lists `relations` toward others (`"hostile" | "neutral" | "friendly"`) with `towardSelf`/`towardOthers` fallbacks; `relationBetween(a, b)` resolves it (mirroring undeclared directions when `symmetric`, defaulting `unaligned` for unknowns). `createFactionRoster(graph)` maps entities to factions (`assign`/`factionOf`/`members`), then `relationBetweenEntities`/`isHostile`/`hostilesOf(observer, candidates)` answer "who is my enemy" as a data lookup — feed it into `scene/targeting`'s `classify` and `ai/threat` eligibility instead of a per-game role-string check. `createReputationLedger({ tiers?, initial?, min?, max? })` is the per-actor standing ledger: `gain`/`set`/`standing` track reputation, `tier`/`relation` map it through `DEFAULT_REPUTATION_TIERS` (the classic Hated→Exalted ladder, or your own), `standings(actor)` snapshots all. `effectiveRelation({ base, ledger, actorId, factionId })` overlays a player's earned standing on the base faction relation, so a reputation grind flips a normally-hostile faction to neutral/friendly.
## Map, fog of war & ping
Minimap/world-map/fog/compass state is renderer-free core (`world/*`), the top-down terrain image bakes in the shell, and the minimap/compass/world-map are react components. Ping rides the existing party + feed — it is not a new channel.
- **Markers** (`world/markers`): `createMarkerSet()` is a reactive keyed set of `MapMarker { id, kind, position, label?, owner?, expiresAt?, meta? }` — `add`/`remove`/`get`/`list`/`query({ kind, owner, near, radius })`/`prune(now)`/`subscribe`. `kind` is a game-owned catalog string; `DEFAULT_MARKER_KINDS` (objective/enemy/loot/location/danger/ping/player/ally) supplies colors + glyphs the react map reads (override with your own `MarkerKindStyle` palette). Objective/entity/loot markers all live here.
- **Fog of war** (`world/fog`): `createFogField({ bounds, cellSize })` is reveal-on-event — `reveal(x, z, radius?)` (a dig/act), `revealAlong(from, to, radius?)` (a walked trail); once a cell is revealed it stays revealed. `isRevealed`/`fraction`/`cells()` (stable snapshot for rendering)/`reset`/`subscribe`.
- **Minimap math** (`world/minimap`): pure projection + bearings — `projectToMinimap(worldPoint, { center, worldRadius, size, rotate? })` → pixel `{ x, y, inside, distance }` (north = −Z maps up), `clampToMinimapEdge` for off-map markers, `compassBearing(from, to)`/`headingToBearing(yaw)`/`bearingToCardinal`/`relativeBearing` for the compass strip.
- **Ping** (`game/ping`): `classifyPing(hit, { roleOf, categoryOf }, options?)` turns a G1 `pointer.worldHit()` `PointerHit` into a category (hostile entity → `enemy`, tagged object → its catalog category, open ground/ally → `location`). `createPingSystem({ markers, feed, party?, ttlMs?, classify, classifyOptions? })` composes classify + broadcast: `ping(from, hit, category?)` classifies, drops a categorized marker, and pushes the `PingPayload` to the party feed under `PING_FEED_ACTION` (`"party.ping"`) — the shell's feed bridge fans it to the squad. `DEFAULT_PING_CATEGORIES` is the enemy/loot/location/danger wheel. Enable the verb with the `pointer.pingCommand` field of `defineGame({...})`: the shell binds the `ping` input action → `worldHit()` → runs your command with `{ point, entity, object, normal }`.
- **Shell render** (`@jgengine/shell/map`): `bakeTerrainMap(field, bounds, { resolution? })` renders a `TerrainField`/`RegionField` to a top-down PNG data-URL for the map background; `MapMarkerBeacons({ markers })` renders world-space beacons (the visible side of a ping) — wire via the `WorldOverlay` field of `defineGame({...})`. See the `extraction-map` demo game.
## Sensors, vision & observer tools (`sensor/`)
Pure `@jgengine/core/sensor/*` primitives for querying and surfacing world state the player can't normally see or reach through the standard occlusion/proximity rules — reveal vision, hidden-state sensors, photo-mode framing, and session replay. Shell renderers/HUD pieces live in `@jgengine/shell/vision` and `@jgengine/shell/replay`.
| Primitive | Answers |
|-----------|---------|
| `createRevealQuery({ resolvePosition, resolveTags, candidates })` → `RevealQuery` | `inRadius(center, radius, tags)` — occlusion-ignoring tagged-entity radius query (Dark Sight / detective-vision reveal, #115). `inRadius` already never checks occlusion (only combat's AoE `effect()` layers a LoS filter on top of it) — this is that same query shaped for a vision readout: scoped to catalog-declared tags, sorted nearest-first |
| `probeHiddenState(origin, sources, { range, variableId, falloff? })` / `probeHiddenStateAll(...)` → `SensorReading \| null` | A sensor verb: reads a hidden zone/entity state variable (EMF/thermometer/geiger, #116) in range, strongest reading first; `strength` falls off linearly with distance by default |
| `projectToView(camera, point)` → `FrustumProjection` | Pure camera-frustum projection (no three.js) — `inView`, `screenX/screenY` (-1..1), `distance` |
| `framingScore(projection, config?)` → `number` | 0..1 framing quality from screen-center placement + distance-to-ideal (photo-mode "is this subject framed", #117) |
| `createFrustumSensor(config?)` → `FrustumSensor` | `tick(camera, targets, dt)` — per-target in-view + framing + `dwellSeconds` (resets the instant a target leaves frame); a view-frustum sensor on a held camera object (Content Warning-style monster-filming scoring) |
| `createRecordingBuffer(options?)` → `RecordingBuffer<T>` | `append(t, data)` / `seek(t)` / `range(fromT, toT)` — a session-recording buffer for replay/photo mode/kill-cam (#120), keyed on game-time so pause/fast-forward scrub consistently |
| `colorDistance(a, b)` / `concealmentScore(entityColors, backgroundColors)` / `createConcealmentSensor(config?)` → `ConcealmentSensor` | Camouflage/blend-in scoring — how well an entity's palette matches its surroundings (hide-and-seek, stealth camo checks) against a `threshold` |
| `createFreezeMonitor(config?)` → `FreezeMonitor` | Detects a tracked subject moving past a tolerance speed during a "freeze" window (red-light-green-light, statue games) and reports `FreezeViolation`s |
Shell wiring: `@jgengine/shell/vision/RevealVision` (`RevealHighlights` — depth-test-disabled 3D highlight meshes for tagged entities in radius, meant for `WorldOverlay`; `RevealScreenTint` — full-screen CSS tint for "vision mode is on", meant for `GameUI`), `@jgengine/shell/vision/HiddenStateProbeHud` (`SensorReadoutMeter` — needle-strength HUD readout), `@jgengine/shell/vision/FrustumSensorHud` (`FrustumSensorReadout` — drives the sensor off the live render camera via `useThree`/`useFrame`, portals its HUD through drei's `Html fullscreen`), `@jgengine/shell/replay/useSessionRecorder` (records an entity's pose into a `RecordingBuffer` every frame; drive an observer-cam ghost, scrubber, or kill-cam export from it). The detached spectator/photo cam itself is the `observer` camera rig (see Camera rigs above) — bind it to any entity or fixed point.
