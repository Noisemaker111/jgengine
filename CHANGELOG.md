# Changelog

All eight `@jgengine/*` packages are versioned in lockstep, so this one file
covers every release. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com);
each release **leads with a Migrate block** — the concrete steps to move a game
from the previous version onto the new APIs — because the point of a bump is to
let consumers pick up the better stuff, not just to list what moved.

Agents building on the published SDK can also read this programmatically:
`import { VERSION, CHANGELOG } from "@jgengine/core/meta/changelog"` gives the
same data as typed values, so an updater can diff its installed version against
the latest and surface the migration steps.

## Unreleased

### Migrate

- Optional (additive): replace a game's hand-rolled `progression/curves.ts` with the new `leveling(...)` track. `leveling({ xpForLevel: { kind: "power", base, exponent, round: "floor" }, maxLevel })` returns `xpForLevel`, `resolve`, and `grantXp(ctx.scene.entity.stats, userId, amount, onLevelUp?)` — a drop-in for the old `xpRequiredForLevel` / `resolveLevelProgress` / `grantXp` exports. `ctx.scene.entity.stats` satisfies the primitive's `LevelingStatAccess` structurally, so no adapter is needed.

### Added

- `@jgengine/core/game/progression` — genre-agnostic progression primitive. `curve(spec)` / `evalCurve(spec, x)` evaluate declarative scalar curves (`const`, `linear`, `power`, `geometric`, `steps`, `piecewise`, each with optional `round`/`min`/`max`) for speed-by-level, difficulty-by-wave, loot drop-rate ramps, and similar scaling. `leveling(config)` builds the stateful XP→level track (threshold accumulation, multi-level grants, cap handling, `stat.levelUp` emit) on top of an `xpForLevel` curve.

## 0.4.0

Baseline release: the eight `@jgengine/*` packages (core, ws, sql, react,
convex, node, shell, assets) as the first tracked version. No migration —
this is the floor changelog entries are measured against.
